Step 1: Introduction

This project explores the trends and patterns of rare and threatened bird species in Denmark from 1998 to 2024. The goal is to raise awareness about biodiversity changes and spotlight individual conservation stories.

Credits to the amazing team of researchers, data analysts, and conservationists. Special thanks to the (fictional) Birdwatchers Association of Denmark for their support.
